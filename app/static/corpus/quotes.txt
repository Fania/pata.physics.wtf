in posthumous collaboration
the decomposing brain goes on working after death and it is its dreams that are Paradise
plagiarism by anticipation
the applause of silence is the only kind that counts
to understand pataphysics is to fail to understand pataphysics
duration is the transformation of a succession into a reversion
god is the tangential point between zero and infinity
laughter is born out of the discovery of the contradictory
ha ha
the aesthetic of formal constraint
the unique imaginary solution to the absence of problems 
the contemporary relationship between science and poetry
a huge and elaborately constructed hoax
only those who attempt the absurd achieve the impossible
the random is opposed to the deterministic
pure multiplicity irreducible to any other sort of unity
persistence and perseverance to buttress a fleeting existence
enfolding a subject laterally, associatively
a doctrine of correspondences, counterpoised by the exotic charm of another system of thought
double negative is necessary to stop the mind believing
the absence of contradictory evidence is not proof of a theory’s validity
very wrong in very important ways
no one point of view is final
unification of opposites
an athletic aesthetics of intuitive and instantaneous judgments
constantly diverted from any objective by the very progress which their energy sustains
imagination envisions the reconciliation of the individual with the whole
behind the illusion lies knowledge
a biomolecular bibliomecha of breathtaking beauty
indubitably coherent yet absolutely nonsensical
stylistic and formal experimentation can not be dismissed as purely apolitical
variable phoneme sequences in suspension within a cloud of relative epi-cultural etymologies
speculative solutions for imaginary problems
nonsense is nonsense only when we have not yet found the point of view from which it makes sense
laughter is the discord between tensions being resolved
read with intention to rewrite
a fractal geometry of momentums
minimizing energy, crystallizing latent structure, pleasure is understood as a practice, and accumulates as experience
don’t fall out of love
the ‘something like’, the pseudo
the text transforms itself as soon as it is understood
adaptation of archaic mental structures to new environments
a beautifully controlled yet hideously wasteful catastrophe
driven by compulsive urgency to constantly reconceive the whole idea
writing the unrightable wrongs
prisoners of conscience
machina sapiens negotiating the transformation of what is mortal into what is immortal
